---

Thesis is an AI-powered DeFi research platform that goes deep, fast. Our platform transforms complex, multi-source research into streamlined, AI-assisted workflows that deliver deep contextual insights. Built specifically for crypto and financial professionals, Thesis connects premium on-chain and off-chain data sources through an intelligent Agent Spaces system, enabling users to create custom research playbooks and maintain shared context across teams.

## What is Thesis?

Thesis revolutionizes how professionals conduct DeFi research by combining advanced AI agents with comprehensive data connectivity. Unlike traditional research tools that require manual data aggregation from multiple sources, Thesis provides a unified workspace where AI agents can access, analyze, and synthesize information from diverse premium data sources in real-time.

### How It Works

The platform operates through:

**Standard Research** - standard research mode where users can:

- **Quick Web Search**: Quickly search the web for information. This feature is completely free for all users.
- **Deep DeFi Research**: Perform deep research on DeFi protocols, tokens, market data, and social media sentiment. For free users, this feature is limited to a certain number of conversations. For paid users, there are less constraints. For more information, please see [Pricing](https://app.thesis.io/pricing).

**Agent Spaces** - customizable research environments where users can:

- **Define Research Scope**: Set specific parameters and objectives for your analysis
- **Own your system prompt**: Customize the system prompt to your needs.
- **Upload Private Intelligence**: Integrate proprietary documents, CSVs, and PDFs for more private insights.
- **Structure Knowledge**: Create inherited knowledge sections for consistent context
