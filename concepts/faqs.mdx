  <Accordion title="🔍 What is Thesis.io?" icon="search">
    **Thesis.io** is the first **AI-Native Research Engine for DeFi**. We help you discover the best DeFi protocols, tokens, market data, and social media sentiment through our advanced search capabilities.

    Our platform processes millions of data points from:
    - **CEXs & DEXs** - Centralized and decentralized exchanges
    - **Lending Protocols** - DeFi lending and borrowing platforms  
    - **Stablecoins** - USD-pegged digital assets
    - **Social Media** - X (Twitter), Reddit, and other platforms

    This curated data powers our Deep AI Search Engine to deliver DeFi insights instantly.

  <Accordion title="🤖 How is Thesis.io different from LLMs?" icon="robot">
    While general-purpose LLMs provide broad AI capabilities, **Thesis.io is a specialized Deep AI Search Engine** built exclusively for DeFi.

    **Key Differences:**
    - **Domain Focus** - We specialize in DeFi data and insights only
    - **Data Depth** - Access to millions of curated DeFi data points unavailable to general LLMs
    - **Real-time Intelligence** - Live market data and protocol analytics
    - **Expert Tools** - Purpose-built DeFi research and analysis capabilities

    General LLMs lack the specialized DeFi knowledge and real-time data that Thesis.io provides.

    - **Deep Research** - Claude Sonnet 4 for complex reasoning and tool orchestration
    - **Specific Tasks** - Smaller, faster models for targeted operations
    - **API Integration** - RESTful APIs for seamless developer integration

    **For Developers:**
    Our APIs enable Web3 developers to integrate Thesis.io's DeFi intelligence into their applications, letting them focus on building the next billion-dollar project instead of learning AI infrastructure.
