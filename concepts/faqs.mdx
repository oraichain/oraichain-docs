  <Accordion title="What is Thesis.io?">
    Thesis.io is the first AI-Native Research Engine for DeFi. It helps you find the best DeFi protocols, tokens, market data and social media sentiment. We've curated and processed millions of DeFi data, from CEXs, DEXs, Lending Protocols, Stablecoins, to social media data like X, Reddit, etc. Such data is then used to power our Deep AI Search Engine to help you gather DeFi insights in no time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Thesis.io different from LLMs?">
    Thesis.io is different from LLMs because it is a Deep AI Search Engine for DeFi. It is not a general-purpose LLM. It is a Deep AI Search Engine for DeFi that helps you find the best DeFi protocols, tokens, market data and social media sentiment. We've curated and processed millions of DeFi data, from CEXs, DEXs, Lending Protocols, Stablecoins, to social media data like X, Reddit, etc. Such data is then used to power our Deep AI Search Engine to help you gather DeFi insights in no time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can Thesis.io be used in an LLM?">
    Thesis.io uses different LLMs depending on the use case under the hood to power our Deep AI Search Engine. For example, for deep research tasks, we tend to leverage claude-sonnet 4 for reasoning and tool calling. For more distinct and specific tasks, we use smaller but faster LLMs.

    We also publish APIs for developers to integrate Thesis.io into their own applications. By using Thesis.io APIs, Web3 developers can focus on building their next $1B cap projects instead of spending time learning AI.

  <Accordion title="How does Thesis.io compare to other search APIs?">
    Thesis.io is not a general-purpose AI search engine. It focuses deeply on DeFi data and insights by curating and processing millions of DeFi data, from CEXs, DEXs, Lending Protocols, Stablecoins, to social media data like X, Reddit, etc.

    The DeFi tools we built are not available elsewhere, and users on Thesis.io have exclusive access to them. General-purpose AI search engines will not be able to provide the same level of DeFi data and insights since they only crawl websites and surface-level data via browsers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Thesis.io Spaces differ from other AI Agent Frameworks?">
    Other AI Agent Frameworks are developer-first and focus on building agents with lots of customization on the AI side. For example, swarm.ai allows users to customize the AI model and prompt and manage memory. Langchain or Autogen of Microsoft have a very strong ecosystem, but they require developers to have a strong understanding of AI and programming. 
    
    In addition, other AI Agent Frameworks are not focused on DeFi data and insights, so after building an agent, users will need to spend a lot of time and effort to build the DeFi tools themselves to achieve the same level of DeFi data and insights as Thesis.io.

    Meanwhile, Thesis.io is user-first and focuses on providing API access to users to integrate Thesis.io into their own applications. We vision a multi-agent ecosystem built on top of Thesis.io using our APIs, and the freedom to build is in the builders' hands.
